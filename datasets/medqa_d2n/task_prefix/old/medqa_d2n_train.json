Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.

At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.

I felt like my symptoms were the same. \r\nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \r\nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \r\nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \r\nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \r\nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \r\nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \r\nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \r\nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \r\nPatient: Sounds good. \r\nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \r\nPatient: That's reassuring. \r\nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \r\nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \r\nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\r\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \r\nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \r\nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \r\nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \r\nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \r\nDoctor: I see.

She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.

What aggravates your pain?\r\nPatient: Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs. \r\nDoctor: When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?\r\nPatient: It's really on my right. \r\nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\r\nPatient: No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all. \r\nDoctor: Have you been able to return to work?\r\nPatient: Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about.\r\nDoctor: Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times. \r\nDoctor: Did they do anything to help you feel better?\r\nPatient: Really, no, it did not.

The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.",

How long has this been going on? \r\nPatient: For the past three months. I've been using my inhaler every day. I used to use it every now and again. This is definitely new for me. \r\nDoctor: Are you experiencing any allergies alongside your asthma? \r\nPatient: Yes, actually. My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse. \r\nDoctor: Do you take anything for your allergies? \r\nPatient: Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it. Oh and I was on Advair, too. \r\nDoctor: Did the Flonase or Advair help at all? \r\nPatient: I had to stop Advair because it started to bother my lady parts. \r\nDoctor: How so? \r\nPatient: I noticed that it became more itchy as a result. \r\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that.  \r\nPatient: Speaking of this, I wanted to also share that I've been experiencing a lot of P M S symptoms lately. I'm super impatient and moody.  \r\nDoctor: Do you notice these symptoms are still there after you finish your cycle? \r\nPatient: Um lemme think. The symptoms start about a week before my period and tend to get less intense once I get over the first day of bleeding. \r\nDoctor: Are your cycles generally regular? \r\nPatient: For the most part, yes. I feel like they don't last as long as they used to. I'm not sure why. I do, however, notice some spotting after my cycles end. \r\nDoctor: Do you get any night sweats or hot flashes while you're on your period? \r\nPatient: No.\r\nDoctor: Have you had any other medical troubles recently? \r\nPatient: I did have a U T I and some blood in my urine because of it. \r\nDoctor: Do you remember how many times you noticed blood in your urine? \r\nPatient: Hm about three times. I was prescribed antibiotics for it. \r\nDoctor: Have you had any other urinary symptoms since? How about bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or anything of the like? \r\nPatient: Nothing now.  \r\nDoctor: Have you gotten your urine rechecked recently? \r\nPatient: No, not yet. I really should get it checked out again. \r\nDoctor: I can write an order for you if you'd like or you can make an appointment with your urologist. Do you have a specific urologist that you see? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I can call to make the appointment tomorrow. Do I also need to get blood work done?\r\nDoctor: Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here. \r\nPatient: I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done? \r\nDoctor: Do you know what they checked? \r\nPatient: I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.  \r\nDoctor: Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts? \r\nPatient: I can fax them to you once I get them back. \r\nDoctor: That would be great.

She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.

Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. \r\nPatient: They also did the same test this morning. \r\nDoctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats.

He does not have any siblings for a match-related transplant.  He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health. At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period.  He did well with the combination.  Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide.  He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea.  This was subsequently stopped. The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week.  His left leg apparently was swollen.  He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped.  Left leg swelling has disappeared.  The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time.  He admits to smoking marijuana.

Tell me what exactly happened, and how did you notice the symptoms? Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five.\r\nGuest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. \r\nDoctor: Okay. \r\nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \r\nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \r\nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \r\nDoctor: Was she slurring?\r\nGuest_family: Nope. \r\nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \r\nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \r\nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \r\nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\r\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \r\nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \r\nDoctor: How was it after that? \r\nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \r\nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \r\nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her.*****KNOWLEDGE*****memory loss,cognitive decline,age,handedness,did the patient experience memory loss and cognitive decline,age of the patient,handedness of the patient",

Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home.

We'll need to do surgery on this.\r\nGuest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? \r\nDoctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. \r\nGuest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? \r\nDoctor: Historically, it's less than one percent.

I was rushed to the hospital that day. After, they told me to get checked for a follow up. \r\nDoctor: Who told you to have a follow up? \r\nPatient: One of the E R doctors and the kidney doctor. \r\nDoctor: I see. Your records indicate you had some swelling around the eye on May third of two thousand and eight. The cause was unknown. I see you were transferred from A B C Medical Center to X Y Z Medical center that day. \r\nPatient: Yeah, that sounds about right. Were there more details about that? \r\nDoctor: Yeah, there is. It says here you have a history of renal failure, so you needed dialysis. They believe the allergic reaction was due to this medicine called, Keflex, which was used during your dialysis treatment. Does that name ring a bell? \r\nPatient: Yeah, it does. I forgot why they gave it to me.  \r\nDoctor: Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection. \r\nPatient: Oh, I see. \r\nDoctor: I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to? \r\nPatient: I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen. \r\nDoctor: I see. I'll put that down as grass allergies, and environmental and inhalant allergies. Do you have any life-threatening allergic reactions? \r\nPatient: Nope. Never had that. \r\nDoctor: Have you ever had any swelling under the skin due to something you ate or touched? \r\nPatient: Nope. Never had that either. \r\nDoctor: That's great. I'm taking a look at your medications. I see you aren't taking anything for your allergies, but you are taking Atenolol. Do you have high blood pressure? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I do. \r\nDoctor: I see. All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital. \r\nPatient: What were the treatments they gave me? \r\nDoctor: Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well.*****KNOWLEDGE*****age,previous allergic reaction,swelling around the eye,history of renal failure,allergic reaction to keflex,allergies to grass and pollen,life-threatening allergic reactions,swelling due to something eaten or touched,high blood pressure,medications (atenolol),treatments before discharge",

Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.

She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.",

        "input": "Doctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\r\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \r\nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\r\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \r\nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \r\nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\r\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \r\nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\r\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \r\nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \r\nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \r\nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \r\nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \r\nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \r\nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \r\nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \r\nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\r\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \r\nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \r\nDoctor_2: That is correct. \r\nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \r\nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \r\nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \r\nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \r\nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \r\nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \r\nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \r\nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \r\nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \r\nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\r\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \r\nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\r\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \r\nPatient: I tried my best to. \r\nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\r\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\r\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \r\nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \r\nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \r\nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \r\nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \r\nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \r\nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \r\nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\r\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \r\nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \r\nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\r\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \r\nDoctor: What was she places on after?\r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \r\nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \r\nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \r\nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \r\nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \r\nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \r\nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \r\nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \r\nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \r\nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \r\nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \r\nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \r\nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \r\nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\r\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \r\nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \r\nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \r\nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \r\nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \r\nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \r\nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \r\nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \r\nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \r\nPatient: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \r\nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \r\nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \r\nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.*****KNOWLEDGE*****age,diagnosis of erythema nodosum,association of skin lesions with tibia and fibula fracture,cosmetic surgery on jaw,visits to clinic and dermatology,rash in lower extremities and ankles,presence of inflammatory arthritis,sed above 110 and increased cpr,initial suspicion of ibd, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus,40,negative lupus serologies (double-stranded dna, rnp, smith, ro, la),negative cardiolipin antibodies panel,ct scan to rule out lymphoma and sarcoid,b12 deficiency, high methylmalonic and homocysteine levels, low normal b12,iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and low mcv,aggregates of eosinophils found microscopically,treatment with 40mg prednisone followed by colchicine,swelling and sensitive rashes on skin from colchicine,reevaluation by dermatology for erythema nodosum,dexa scan and vitamin d levels checked,varicella and mononucleosis history,heart murmur found, echocardiogram to be conducted,skin rashes sensitive to uv light,joint stiffness mentioned,rash sensitive to uv light experienced during skiing in europe,effect of rashes on acne,effect of prednisone and colchicine on acne,desire to get pregnant and effects of medication on pregnancy",
        "output": "This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.",

He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.

        "output": "This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.",
