I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \r\nDoctor: That does happen.

They're too big. \r\nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \r\nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\r\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \r\nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \r\nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \r\nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \r\nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\r\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \r\nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \r\nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \r\nPatient: No, none. \r\nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \r\nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\r\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \r\nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \r\nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \r\nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \r\nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\r\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \r\nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \r\nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \r\nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \r\nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \r\nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \r\nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \r\nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \r\nPatient: Yes, we think so.",

Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.

He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.",

She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes.  She does experience some leakage with coughing.  She wears the pad on a daily basis.  She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last.  With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time.  She reports no headaches at this time.  With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse.  In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs.  She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy.  She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful.  She feels that she is walking slower for this reason.  She does not use the cane at this time.  Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces.  She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car.",

I felt like my symptoms were the same. \r\nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \r\nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \r\nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \r\nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \r\nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \r\nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \r\nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \r\nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \r\nPatient: Sounds good. \r\nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \r\nPatient: That's reassuring. \r\nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears.

She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.",

What aggravates your pain?\r\nPatient: Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs. \r\nDoctor: When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?\r\nPatient: It's really on my right. \r\nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\r\nPatient: No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all. \r\nDoctor: Have you been able to return to work?\r\nPatient: Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about.\r\nDoctor: Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times. \r\nDoctor: Did they do anything to help you feel better?\r\nPatient: Really, no, it did not.

The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.",

I think I need some drugs; I mean some medications to deal with my issues.\r\nDoctor: Have you ever been on any kind of medicine or treatment before?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I was on Wellbutrin before. It was prescribed by Doctor Jonah. I was eating a lot and even gained like twenty pounds in just a few months.

Normally, at work I just stop when it gets hard to focus and take a walk around the clinic. It has started affecting my work. I need help!\r\nDoctor: Okay, I understand.

I couldn't extend all my fingers out. \r\nDoctor: Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated? \r\nPatient: After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck. \r\nDoctor: Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?\r\nPatient: Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two.\r\nDoctor: Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven.  \r\nPatient: That means tumor, right?\r\nDoctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here. \r\nDoctor: Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?\r\nPatient: Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse. \r\nDoctor: Once your symptoms worsened, what happened? \r\nPatient: Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side. \r\nDoctor: Did you have any weakness, sir?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms.\r\nDoctor: Was one side worse than the other? \r\nPatient: Yes, my right side was worse than my left. \r\nDoctor: In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms? \r\nPatient: Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high. \r\nDoctor: After all these symptoms began, how were you treated? \r\nPatient: On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too. \r\nDoctor: Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa.\r\nPatient: Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?\r\nDoctor: Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too. \r\nDoctor: Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma. \r\nPatient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three. \r\nDoctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms? \r\nPatient: I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four. \r\nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since?\r\nPatient: I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food. \r\nDoctor: How much weakness was there?\r\nPatient: It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself. \r\nDoctor: Can you go up and down stairs?\r\nPatient: No, not really, but I can climb them. \r\nDoctor: How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?\r\nPatient: Yeah, no problems there. \r\nDoctor: Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?\r\nPatient: They were considering doing chemo.",

My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse. \r\nDoctor: Do you take anything for your allergies? \r\nPatient: Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it.

I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things.

She was chosen to be the assassin. \r\nDoctor: Okay. \r\nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \r\nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \r\nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \r\nDoctor: Was she slurring?\r\nGuest_family: Nope. \r\nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \r\nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \r\nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \r\nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\r\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \r\nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \r\nDoctor: How was it after that? \r\nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \r\nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \r\nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her.",

According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.

Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\r\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off.

My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \r\nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\r\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays.

I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night.

He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.

The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation.

Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\r\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \r\nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\r\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \r\nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \r\nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\r\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \r\nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\r\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \r\nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \r\nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \r\nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \r\nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \r\nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \r\nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \r\nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \r\nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\r\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \r\nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \r\nDoctor_2: That is correct. \r\nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \r\nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \r\nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \r\nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \r\nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \r\nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \r\nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \r\nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \r\nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \r\nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\r\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \r\nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\r\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \r\nPatient: I tried my best to. \r\nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\r\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\r\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \r\nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \r\nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \r\nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \r\nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \r\nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \r\nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \r\nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\r\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \r\nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \r\nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\r\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \r\nDoctor: What was she places on after?\r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \r\nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \r\nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \r\nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \r\nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \r\nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \r\nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \r\nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \r\nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \r\nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \r\nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \r\nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \r\nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \r\nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\r\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \r\nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \r\nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \r\nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \r\nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \r\nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \r\nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \r\nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \r\nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \r\nPatient: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \r\nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \r\nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \r\nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.",

She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.",

No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \r\nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\r\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\r\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\r\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\r\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\r\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\r\nPatient: Yeah. I also had shingles.\r\nDoctor: Are you currently living at home?\r\nPatient: I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair. \r\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. \r\nPatient: On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks.\r\nDoctor: Is it all of your fingers or only some?\r\nPatient: All.\r\nDoctor: Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?\r\nPatient: Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.\r\nDoctor: I see.\r\nPatient: I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.\r\nDoctor: Fasciculations?\r\nPatient: Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.\r\nDoctor: Any cramping or problems swallowing?\r\nPatient: No.\r\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing?\r\nPatient: No. \r\nDoctor: Any constipation or diarrhea?\r\nPatient: Both actually. It tends to alternate.\r\nDoctor: But no loss of bowel or bladder control?\r\nPatient: No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand. \r\nDoctor: Okay.\r\nPatient: I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.\r\nDoctor: How long has that been going on?\r\nPatient: Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too.",
        "output": "The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.",

He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.
