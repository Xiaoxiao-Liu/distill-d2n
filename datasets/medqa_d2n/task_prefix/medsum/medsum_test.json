She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off.\nAfter a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac (soy milk) along with breast feeding. I did that and everything smoothened. However, after 2 months, I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk. The doctor asked me to give her formula milk (Nan Pro 0). I did that but just after half an hour, she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach. Once that stopped, she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days. She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk.\nAs she is now 6 months old, I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again. I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live.\nPlease help my daughter in this situation. Please let me know the contact detail may be an email address of any doctor with whom I can discuss my case. Please help us.\nThanks for all your help.\nRegards,\n[cid:",

His dad died, his brother died 2 years ago in a motorcycle accident and about 9 months ago my dear friend got into a car accident. In that car accident he suffered a T-6 and T-7 fracture which cause him to be paralyzed from his waist down. He is so young and it really hurts how much he has suffered in his short life. Not only him, but just thinking how much his mom has suffered it really breaks my heart. I asked him how or what can I do to help him, he did not asked for money or something like, he just said: \"Would you help me to research how to get cured?\". Since I met my friend there is no one day I have stopped thinking in what can I do to make his dream come true. I know we lives in an imperfect world and things happen to people but faith moves mountains.

I am adopted and the records are still sealed and I have a son and a daughter and four grandchildren that could have had this deficiency passed on to them so you see why this is important to me.

I did, and  it seemed to lessen. I started the full dose. Everyday I took the pill, my pain increased! After a few weeks, the pain I usually had in flair ups, had now multiplied to an intolerable level! I stopped the Tecfedra. Unfortunately the pain did not! Until today, my pain level is at it maximum. Nothing I've taken such as Percocet, oxycodone etc. will not relieve it!! I've also since developed frequent  sweating and cellulitis on my left thigh and abdomen! Has anyone else had these problems? PLEASE! If so, tell me what they did to stop them!\nSincerely,\n[NAME] cell [CONTACT]",
