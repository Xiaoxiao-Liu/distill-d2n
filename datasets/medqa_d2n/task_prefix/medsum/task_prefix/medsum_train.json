This first operation had fixed the retina with endolaser, removed vitreous body filled with silicone oil, replaced the lens with an artificial one and stabilized the pressure to around 15-10 mp. However, the eye got blood, retina got detached and it had to be operated again. This time, the oil replaced with gas.\nAfter 2 years, another attempt made with oil and lastly with gas, but the retina fallen again and again.\nCurrently, the retina is still detached, the pressure is low (max 4 mp), has often blood around the iris and it hurts a bit when the air pressure changes. I cannot see anything with it apart from blur lights. The doctor says, this damaged eye is shrinking continuously.\nMy other eye functioning well. I learned to live together with it, however, the doctor says, he strongly recommends enucleation. I dont know if there is any other option to avoid enucleation.\nI have 2 young children so if there were any option to avoid enucleatio, I would happy travel/pay for that.\nKindly let me know if there is any other option.

I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?",

I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.
