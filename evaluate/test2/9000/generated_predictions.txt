The patient is a 37-year-old left-handed male who was seen here one month ago for headaches, nausea, and vomiting. His exams from that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home. He had the same symptoms on and off after that. He is seeing things blurred and having difficulty concentrating. His headaches are worse when sitting up. He notices them first thing in the morning. He describes his headaches as dull, constant, and it feels like as if his head is wrapped in a tight band. It starts on the forehead and then it kind of goes to the back. It happens like six times a day. Lying down or putting his head down between his knees helps. He also has blurry eyesight, nausea, and vomiting. Any kind of bright light hurts. He is just afraid of loud sounds. I discussed with him about any blind spots, positive visual phenomena, weakness, numbness, tingling or double vision or any speech disorder, but he denies everything.
