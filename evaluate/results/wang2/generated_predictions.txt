This 55-year-old gentleman presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness. He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem. He thinks that approximately six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg. He describes that he was reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe. Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks. He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness. He has chronic mild back pain, but this has not changed. He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year. This dissipated about two months ago. He does not think that his left leg is weak. He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence. He denies radicular pain. He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when he was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October. He then saw me a couple of months later. He has undergone EMG and nerve conduction studies. Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant. He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. He has hyperCKemia. He tells me that he had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me. He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it. Once it was started, it increased to about 800, then came down to about 500 when it was stopped. He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s. He does not have any laboratory data to support these statements, but he seems to be up to speed on this. More recently, he has been started on Zetia. He denies any proximal weakness. He denies any myalgias.
